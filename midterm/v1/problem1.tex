{\bf Problem 1 (5pts)}
\vspace{1cm}


\noindent
(1pt) Assuming right associativity for the MINUS binary operator (-), left-associativity for exponentiation (**),
and ** having a higher precedence than -,
show the evaluation steps and the final result of evaluating the expression: 2 ** 6 ** 0.5 - 9 - 1

\vspace{1in}

\noindent
(1pt) Consider the regular expression: $(a|b) * c+ (bc | dc)*$ \\
\\
  Write two strings that would be rejected and two string that would be accepted by the above regular expression.
  All strings must be at least 4 symbols long.

(0.5pt)  How many unique / distinct tokens would a C scanner produce for the following code snippet

\begin{lstlisting}
while ( a + b < 10 ) b = b + 2 ;
\end{lstlisting}

(1pt) For the below statements, mark either True or False:

\vspace{1cm}

\begin{tabular}{|p{13cm}|p{2cm}|}
\hline
{\bf Statement} & {\bf True/False} \\
\hline
Left/right operator associativity is necessary for the + operator &  \\
\hline
LL parsing works in a bottom-up fashion  &   \\
\hline
Operator associativity deals with the order of evaluation of a sequence of operations of the exact same type	 &  \\
\hline
LL parsers are perfectly suitable to handle left-recursion &  \\

\noindent
(0.5pt) Write a regular expression that would accept the following 4 strings:

\begin{itemize}
\item
a b
\item
a a b b c c
\item
a b b b c c c c
\item
b b b b b b c c c c c
\end{itemize}

\noindent
(1.0pt) 
Write a small grammar that permits to produce lists of function arguments for a C-like language.  
The tokens to use in this grammar are: ID, INT, FLOAT, LEFTPAR '(', RIGHTPAR ')' and COMMA ' , '. $\epsilon$ is the empty string.

\noindent
You can use the pipe character '$|$' to separate multiple right-hand-sides for the same non-terminal.
The grammar can have either left-recursion or right-recursion, but not both types.

Below are 3 examples, one per line, of the strings that could  be accepted:

\begin{itemize}
\item
( int a, int b )

\item
( int a, float b, int c)

\item
( )
\end{itemize}
