\paragraph{Extra Credit Problem: Array Bounds Check (5 points)}

\paragraph{}
You are asked to add a safety feature in your compiler. The new feature
consists on checking that no out-of-bounds access is attempted on an array, neither when reading nor writing.
Notice that this \texttt{check} is performed at run-time, i.e. when the application
is running.

\paragraph{}
You have total freedom in deciding how to implement this feature. Just bear in mind 
that it must be a mix of collecting information at compile-time, and using that
information to perform the check at run-time.

\paragraph{}
Please try to be as concise as possible. Rambling will not get you too many extra points.
