The script test-re.sh requires as input 2 filenames, preferably in the working directory.
The first file contains the strings used as input. One per line is better.
The second file contains regular expressions to test. Single line. 
Refer to the GREP manual (run man grep in a linux console or just search for it in the web).
The correctness of your regular expression should be obvious.


Example:
./test-re.sh test1.txt re1.txt

As an exercise, you can write your own input test files and your own regular expressions.
