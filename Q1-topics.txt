Suggested topics to study and review:
- Overall compilation flow
- Understand the purpose of each stage
- Go through the example
- Review recordings when I mention the automatic generation of temporary variables.
- Role of symbol table.
- Difference between compiler and interpreter.
- Lexical analysis: 
  * job, different roles, see manual scanner
  * regular expressions: test/practice with provided scripts
- Differences among different types/classes of programming languages (classification)


What I will not ask:
- History of PLs
- Classification of PLs.
- Motivation of PLs

Slides, books, notes and tools (aka testing a regular expression with GREP or so) allowed during quiz.
